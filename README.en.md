# Outlook Email Plus

[中文 README](./README.md) · [Release Playbook](./RELEASE.md)

OutlookMail Plus is a mailbox manager built for individuals and teams that work heavily with registration flows.

Unlike general-purpose email clients, it focuses on **registration and verification** workflows and is deeply optimized around getting those flows done quickly.

### Why OutlookMail Plus

- **Built for registration workflows**: it removes unnecessary steps as much as possible. You can copy mailbox addresses with one click; after sending a verification email on a signup page, you can return to the manager, click "Verification Code", fetch the latest email, and quickly extract the code or verification link with regex.
- **Lighter and more focused**: non-core features such as sending mail are intentionally left out, so the interface stays cleaner and every design choice is centered on completing registration tasks.
- **Broader import compatibility**: it supports mainstream mailbox providers such as Gmail, QQ, and 163, as well as custom IMAP servers. Self-hosted mailboxes also work. Built-in CF Worker temp mailboxes support multi-domain configuration and Admin Key encryption, significantly reducing privacy exposure in registration workflows.
- **Automation-friendly**: it exposes APIs for batch registration workflows; the mail pool supports project-scoped isolation via `project_key`, so already-used accounts are never re-claimed within the same project. Mailbox claiming, verification-code retrieval, and release are all covered.
- **Third-party notifications**: third-party notification channels are supported. Telegram is already integrated, and important mailboxes can push alerts automatically.

In short, OutlookMail Plus is a mailbox manager designed specifically for registration workflows.

## Demo Site

Demo site: https://gbcoinystsyz.ap-southeast-1.clawcloudrun.com  
Login password: `12345678`

The site includes 10 mailbox accounts for demonstration. Data is periodically reset. Please do not delete the demo accounts or use them for personal purposes.

The demo covers most major features in this project, except Telegram push (which requires additional configuration).

## UI Preview

The repository already includes some screenshots, and more can be added later.

## Recent Updates

Highlights include:

- Current stable version: `v1.14.0`

**One-Click Update**
- Two update methods: Watchtower (recommended) and Docker API self-update (advanced)
- Automatic GitHub release detection with in-app update banner
- Full deployment info detection: image tag, local build, Watchtower connectivity, etc.
- Watchtower "already latest" smart detection (based on Watchtower synchronous behavior)
- Docker API digest pre-check — skips update when already on latest version
- Fixed browser caching stale JS files

**Mail Pool Enhancements**
- Project-scoped claim isolation (PR#27): `claim-random` now accepts a `project_key` parameter; accounts already used under the same `caller_id + project_key` combination are not re-claimed (DB v17)

**CF Worker Temp Mail**
- Multi-domain support: multiple CF Worker domains can now be configured in the Settings page; a new "Sync Domains" button refreshes the domain list in one click
- Admin Key encrypted at rest: `cf_worker_admin_key` is now stored with an `enc:` prefix using symmetric encryption and is no longer saved in plaintext (DB v18)

**Frontend UX Fixes**
- BUG-06: mailbox selection highlight is correctly preserved after generating or deleting a temp mailbox
- BUG-07: domain dropdown selection is no longer reset when the temp-mail panel refreshes its message list
- Issue #24: fixed email expand/active state being lost on re-render, i18n language switch not refreshing the account list, and viewport height chain breakage

**Poll Engine Refactor**
- Merged the dual polling systems (standard mode + compact mode) into a single unified `poll-engine` (4-phase refactor)
- Fixed batch email fetching on initial load, duplicate poll start on group switch, and cross-view poll state accumulation

**Account List**
- Added frontend pagination (50 accounts per page) for smoother rendering with large account sets

**i18n**
- Added bilingual translations for temp-mail panel domain hint texts and CF Worker domain sync button
- Emoji-prefixed text translations, settings tab labels, and connectivity/update status messages

## Core Capabilities

## Quick Start

### Docker Deployment

**Option 1: docker run (quick start)**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name outlook-email-plus \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -e SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here \
  -e LOGIN_PASSWORD=your-login-password \
  -e ALLOW_LOGIN_PASSWORD_CHANGE=false \
  guangshanshui/outlook-email-plus:latest
```

**Option 2: docker-compose (recommended, includes one-click update)**

Save the following as `docker-compose.yml`, then run `docker-compose up -d`:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/zeropointsix/outlook-email-plus:latest   # Recommended (more stable in some regions)
    # image: guangshanshui/outlook-email-plus:latest         # Docker Hub alternative
    container_name: outlook-email-plus
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5001:5000"           # Change to 5000:5000 or any other port
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      SECRET_KEY: "${SECRET_KEY:?Set SECRET_KEY in .env}"
      # One-click update token: leave empty to use the built-in default;
      # for production, set a random strong password
      WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN: "${WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN:-outlook-mail-plus-watchtower-default}"
      # Docker API self-update (optional, advanced)
      # ⚠️ Enabling this allows the container to control other containers via Docker API
      # DOCKER_SELF_UPDATE_ALLOW: "false"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      # Docker socket mount (optional, only for Docker API self-update)
      # ⚠️ Mounting docker.sock grants the container full Docker API access
      # - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    labels:
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
    networks:
      - outlook-net

  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    container_name: watchtower
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN=${WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN:-outlook-mail-plus-watchtower-default}
      - WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_UPDATE=true
      - WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP=true
      - WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_PERIODIC_POLLS=false
    command: --http-api-update --label-enable
    labels:
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=false"
    networks:
      - outlook-net

networks:
  outlook-net:
    driver: bridge
```

Notes:

- Always mount `data/` to avoid losing the database and runtime data
- `SECRET_KEY` must stay stable and strong; generate a random 64-char value: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`
- `WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN` **can be left empty** — both app and watchtower will automatically use the same built-in default, making one-click update work out of the box; for production, use a random strong password
- Once configured, the UI will show an update banner when a new version is detected; click "Update Now" to upgrade
- One-click update **only works with docker-compose deployment**; `docker run` single-container mode is not supported

**Update Methods**: Watchtower is the default (recommended). To use Docker API self-update (no Watchtower required), you need to:
1. Uncomment `DOCKER_SELF_UPDATE_ALLOW` and set it to `"true"`
2. Uncomment the docker.sock volume mount
3. Switch "Update Method" to "Docker API" in Settings
4. ⚠️ Please fully understand the security implications before enabling

### Local Run

```bash
python -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
python web_outlook_app.py
```

### Run Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Common Environment Variables

- `SECRET_KEY`
  Required for session security and sensitive-data encryption
- `LOGIN_PASSWORD`
  Initial backend login password; after first startup it is hashed and stored in the database
- `ALLOW_LOGIN_PASSWORD_CHANGE`
  Whether login password changes are allowed in Settings. For demo sites, set this to `false`
- `DATABASE_PATH`
  SQLite database path. Default: `data/outlook_accounts.db`
- `PORT` / `HOST`
  Web server bind address
- `SCHEDULER_AUTOSTART`
  Whether background scheduler jobs start automatically
- `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
  Outlook OAuth application ID
- `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`
  Outlook OAuth callback URL
- `GPTMAIL_BASE_URL`
  GPTMail service URL
- `GPTMAIL_API_KEY`
  GPTMail API key for temp-mail capabilities

### One-Click Update

- `WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN`
  Watchtower API auth token. **Can be left empty** — both app and watchtower automatically use the same built-in default, making it work out of the box; for production, use a random strong password
- `WATCHTOWER_API_URL`
  Watchtower API address, default `http://watchtower:8080` (Docker internal network, usually no need to change)
- `DOCKER_SELF_UPDATE_ALLOW`
  Whether to enable Docker API self-update, default `false`. ⚠️ Grants container Docker API access when enabled
- `DOCKER_IMAGE`
  Current container image name (optional, for deployment info detection)

> **Security Note**: Docker API self-update requires mounting `/var/run/docker.sock`, which grants full Docker API access to the container. For production environments, Watchtower is recommended.

## Notification Channels

### Email Notifications

If you want to enable business email notifications, you need to configure SMTP separately. Email notifications, Telegram, and GPTMail are independent channels and do not replace each other.

Minimum required variables:

- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_HOST`
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_FROM`

Common optional variables:

- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PORT`
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_USERNAME`
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PASSWORD`
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_USE_TLS`
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_USE_SSL`
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_TIMEOUT`

Example:

```env
EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_HOST=smtp.qq.com
EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PORT=465
EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_FROM=your_account@qq.com
EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_USERNAME=your_account@qq.com
EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_auth_code
EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_USE_SSL=true
EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_USE_TLS=false
EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_TIMEOUT=15
```

Notes:

- the Settings page follows a save-first-then-test flow
- the test endpoint does not read temporary values from the form
- the system only uses the saved `email_notification_recipient`

### Telegram Push

The Settings page supports:

- `telegram_bot_token`
- `telegram_chat_id`
- `telegram_poll_interval`

In the current version, Telegram push and business email notifications are both handled by the unified notification-dispatch flow.

## External API and Mail Pool Integration

If you want to connect this project to registration workers, script platforms, or other automation systems, the recommended path is the controlled external API:

- path prefix: `/api/external/*`
- auth header: `X-API-Key`
- mail-pool endpoints: `/api/external/pool/*`

Current external API capabilities include:

- single-key authentication
- multi-key configuration
- mailbox scope restrictions per caller
- public-mode allowlists and rate limits
- the ability to disable risky endpoints such as raw-content reading and long polling

Notes:

- the old anonymous `/api/pool/*` endpoints have been removed
- in production, controlled public mode with allowlists is recommended

## Demo Site Recommendation

If you want to expose a demo site to other users, at minimum use:

```env
LOGIN_PASSWORD=your-strong-password
ALLOW_LOGIN_PASSWORD_CHANGE=false
```

- the site remains usable
- visitors cannot change the backend login password from Settings
